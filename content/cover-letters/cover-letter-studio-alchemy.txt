With my extensive experience in scaling brands, driving digital transformation, and leveraging cutting-edge marketing technologies, I am confident that I possess the skills and vision to lead Tinytography to become a £10M+ revenue powerhouse.

Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated the ability to develop and execute data-driven marketing strategies that deliver exceptional results. As Director of Marketing Technology at Stoltzfus Structures and Horizon Structures, a company with over $70 million in annual revenue, I spearheaded a comprehensive digital transformation initiative.  This involved migrating multiple websites to a modern tech stack, resulting in significant improvements in site speed, SEO performance, and customer experience.  I also have a proven track record of success in building and refining AI-powered marketing funnels, optimizing paid social advertising campaigns with budgets exceeding $1.5 million annually, and implementing social listening to identify emerging trends and target markets.    

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to join Studio Alchemy at this pivotal stage of growth. Your company's mission to transform everyday photos into beautifully enhanced images using AI technology resonates deeply with my passion for leveraging technology to create innovative and impactful solutions.  I am confident that my skills and experience in brand building, content strategy, community engagement, and digital optimization will be invaluable as we work together to scale Tinytography into a globally recognized brand.   

I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual with a strong entrepreneurial spirit.  I thrive in fast-paced, high-stakes startup environments and am comfortable taking ownership of projects from ideation to execution.  I am also a collaborative leader with excellent communication and interpersonal skills, and I am confident that I can effectively build and manage a high-performing marketing team.    

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to learn more about this exciting opportunity and discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to Studio Alchemy's continued success.
