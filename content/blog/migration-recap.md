# **Our Journey**

Managing a network of WordPress sites with **200-300k unique users per month** and over **one million monthly sessions combined** was becoming unsustainable. We needed a **faster, more flexible, and future-proof** solution—enter **headless architecture**.

Migrating to a headless CMS sounds straightforward, but untangling years of **legacy code**, managing **RESTful API integrations**, and ensuring **buy-in from stakeholders** was anything but simple. There were plenty of late nights, unexpected technical challenges, and a staging environment meltdown just before a major demo. (Let’s just say **a lot of coffee** was involved.)

However, the end result? A **high-performing, scalable, and developer-friendly system** that allowed us to iterate on content faster than ever before.

## **Why Migrate from WordPress?**

WordPress served us well, but as our businesses grew, the limitations became clear:

- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Our WordPress setup struggled under high traffic, resulting in slow page loads.
- **Scalability Issues**: Managing multiple high-traffic sites became difficult without a more modular system.
- **Developer Workflow Constraints**: WordPress’s monolithic nature made it harder to implement modern development workflows.
- **Content Management Limitations**: Editors and developers needed a more flexible, API-driven approach to content updates.

To address these challenges, we adopted a **headless architecture** built around **Next.js, Sanity.io, and a robust CDN-backed deployment system**.

## **Our New Architecture**

### **Frontend**
- **Next.js**: Enables fast, server-rendered and statically generated pages for improved performance and SEO.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides a consistent, scalable design system.
- **Storybook**: Standardizes UI components across all sites.

### **Content Management**
- **Sanity.io**: A real-time, headless CMS with **GROQ-powered queries** and strong developer flexibility.

### **Performance and Deployment**
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Delivers content quickly via edge caching.
- **WebPageTest and Lighthouse**: Used for performance benchmarking and optimization.

### **Additional Enhancements**
- **AI-Generated Alt Text**: A machine vision-powered system generates accurate image descriptions to improve accessibility.
- **Automated Content Migration**: Scripts were developed to transfer thousands of pages, posts, and media files from WordPress to Sanity.io.

## **Challenges and Solutions**

### **1. Migrating Legacy Content**
**Challenge**: Years of posts, pages, and media files needed to be migrated to Sanity.io.
**Solution**: We developed **automated migration scripts**, but edge cases required manual intervention.

### **2. Ensuring Performance at Scale**
**Challenge**: Could our new setup handle the same level of traffic as WordPress?
**Solution**: We conducted extensive **load testing** and used **Lighthouse/WebPageTest** to optimize page speed, achieving **100% Lighthouse scores**.

### **3. Improving Image Accessibility**
**Challenge**: Many WordPress images had poor or missing alt text.
**Solution**: We implemented an **AI-powered alt-text generator** to create descriptive tags, improving **SEO and accessibility**.

## **Key Learnings and Unexpected Wins**

- **Massive Performance Gains**: Page load times decreased dramatically, improving both user experience and SEO rankings.
- **Modular Flexibility**: Headless architecture allowed for easy integration of new tools and features.
- **Streamlined Content Workflows**: Our team could now publish updates **faster and with more flexibility**.

## **Final Thoughts**

Migrating to a headless architecture was more than a technical upgrade—it was a **paradigm shift** in how we approach web development. The flexibility, performance, and scalability we gained have positioned us for **long-term growth**.
