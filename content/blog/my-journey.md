# My Journey in Tech

Throughout my career in technology, I've had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects and technologies. My experience spans from full-stack development to marketing technology, allowing me to bridge the gap between technical implementation and business strategy.

## Early Career

I started my journey after completing App Academy's Full-Stack Web Development program. This intensive bootcamp gave me a strong foundation in modern web technologies and best practices. The program's focus on practical projects and pair programming helped me develop not just technical skills, but also the ability to collaborate effectively with other developers.

## Growth in Marketing Technology

As I progressed in my career, I found myself increasingly drawn to the intersection of marketing and technology. This led me to roles where I could leverage my technical skills to solve marketing challenges. I've worked extensively with marketing automation platforms, CRM systems, and analytics tools to help businesses better understand and serve their customers.

## Current Focus

Today, I specialize in building and implementing marketing technology solutions that drive business growth. My work involves creating seamless integrations between various marketing tools, developing custom solutions when needed, and ensuring that our technical implementations align with business objectives.

## Skills and Technologies

Some of the key technologies I work with include:
- Next.js and React for frontend development
- Node.js for backend services
- Marketing automation platforms like Salesforce Marketing Cloud
- CRM systems and integrations
- Analytics and tracking implementations

## Future Direction

I'm particularly excited about the potential of AI and machine learning in marketing technology. I believe these technologies will revolutionize how businesses interact with their customers, and I'm actively working to incorporate them into my skill set.
